Python has various built-in data types categorized into:

Numeric Types
int = Integer values (e.g., x = 10)
float = Decimal values (e.g., y = 3.14)
complex = Complex numbers (e.g., z = 2 + 3j)

Sequence Types
str = String (e.g., name = "Python")
list = Ordered, mutable (e.g., mylist = [1, 2, 3])
tuple = Ordered, immutable (e.g., mytuple = (1, 2, 3))

Set Types
set = Unordered, no duplicates (e.g., s = {1, 2, 3})
frozenset = Immutable version of set

Mapping Type
dict = Key-value pairs (e.g., d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2})

Boolean Type
bool = True or False

Binary Types
bytes, bytearray, memoryview – for binary data handling

None Type
NoneType → Represents absence of value (e.g., x = None)
